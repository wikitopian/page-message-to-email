# Facebook Message to Email

This is a WordPress plugin which relies on wp_cron to regularly poll FB for
more messages to the pages a registered user administrates. If it finds them,
it relies on wp_mail to send them to a specified email address.

The problem this plugin solves is ensuring that feedback delivered to the project's
page ends up reviewed promptly.

## Getting Started

Install the plugin, fill in the required fields in the `Settings > Page 2 Email`,
and hope it works.

## Contributing

I'm terrible about following up on my projects on here. You'll probably want to
just give up and fork it if you think it needs improved upon (as it probably
does). No hard feelings whatsoever.

## Donating

When you give money to homeless people, you're supporting their drug addiction.

When you give money to geeks, it works the same way. I'm addicted to coding.

Please give generously.
